Share
=============

This was my final project for [Launch Academy](https://launchacademy.com/). Share allows users to post public and public goods. Public goods can be seens by all users. Private goods are specific to user created groups.

Next steps: 

- Build off of the existing house and map beta, make this functionality available to groups
- Add a claim model that lets users claim available goods
